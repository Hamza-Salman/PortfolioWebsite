              For as long as I can remember, I've always wanted to know what made machines <b>'tick'.</b> This lead to alot of broken toys and rc cars I couldn't put back together as my 9 year old self. Eventually I <b>learned</b> how to build my first computer and not long after I wanted to <b>make my own games </b> which lead me into <b>programming</b> where  <b>I fell in love with computers.</b>
              <br />
              <br />Today, I am fluent in programming languages like
              <i>
                <b> Java, HTML/CSS, PHP, Javascript and Python. </b>
              </i>
              <br />
              <br />
              My field of Interest's are building new &nbsp;
              <i>
                <b>Web applications </b> and
                also in areas related to{" "}
                <b>
                  Deep Learning and Natural Launguage Processing.
                </b>
              </i>
              <br />
              <br />
              For fun, I like developing applications
              with <b>Node.js</b> and
              <i>
                <b>
                  {" "}
                  Modern Javascript Library and Frameworks
                </b>
              </i>
              &nbsp; like
              <i>
                <b> React.js and Next.js </b>
              </i>
               due to modern features and it's simplicity which makes its faster to create something that works quickly with minimal code needed.
